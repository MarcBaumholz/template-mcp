## 🎉 Recently Completed Tasks

### June 24, 2025 - JSON Parsing Error Fixed ✅
**Issue:** Upload API specification was failing with "Unexpected token 'D', '[DEBUG] OPE'... is not valid JSON"

**Root Cause:** Debug print statements in `server_fast.py` were outputting to stdout, which was being captured by the MCP client and parsed as JSON instead of the actual API response.

**Solution:** 
- Replaced `print()` statements with proper `logger.debug()` calls
- Debug output now goes to logging system instead of stdout
- MCP client now receives clean JSON responses

**Verification:**
- ✅ Upload test successful: `test_debug_fix` collection created
- ✅ 1 chunk uploaded from `test_api.json`
- ✅ No debug output interfering with JSON parsing
- ✅ All MCP tools functioning correctly
