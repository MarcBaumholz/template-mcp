# API Fields Analysis

**Generated:** 2025-06-18 10:10:54
**Collection:** flip_api_v2
**Fields:** start_date, end_date

Okay, here is a structured analysis of the `start_date` and `end_date` fields based on the provided API documentation context.

---

**Analysis of `start_date` Field**

1.  **Purpose and Meaning:**
    *   Represents the beginning date of a specific time period.
    *   Primarily used within the context of time-off requests (`HrisCreateTimeOffRequestDto`) and time-off records (`TimeOff`).
    *   Indicates when the leave, shift change, or time entry period starts.

2.  **Data Types and Expected Values:**
    *   **Type:** Date (likely `String` or `DateTime` format, though the exact type isn't explicitly stated in the provided context). Based on common practice, it's probable the value follows the ISO 8601 standard (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss`).
    *   **Expected Value:** A valid date. It is a required field in the `HrisCreateTimeOffRequestDto` schema (implied by its presence in a request object without a `null` score context). It should represent a point in time.

3.  **Relationships:**
    *   Appears alongside `end_date` in both `HrisCreateTimeOffRequestDto` and `TimeOff` schemas, defining the temporal boundaries of the time-off period.
    *   Associated with other fields like `employee_id`, `approver_id`, `type`, `status`, and potentially `start_half_day`/`end_half_day` which might refine the period definition (e.g., morning vs. afternoon).
    *   Linked to `TimeEntryStatusEnum` (low score), suggesting it might be used in conjunction with status information for time entries, but the primary relationship seems to be with time-off.

4.  **Business Context and Usage:**
    *   Core component of managing employee leave and time-off requests within an HR system.
    *   Used to schedule and track periods of absence or approved time off.
    *   Essential for calculating durations, validating leave boundaries, and integrating with calendars or scheduling systems.

5.  **Validation Rules or Constraints:**
    *   **Nullability:** Likely non-nullable, especially in request objects (`HrisCreateTimeOffRequestDto`), as indicated by its presence without a `null` score context.
    *   **Format:** Must adhere to a specific date format (likely ISO 8601).
    *   **Range:** Must be a valid date. (Implicit)
    *   **Relationship with `end_date`:** Must be logically before the `end_date` (i.e., `start_date < end_date`). This is a critical business rule for defining valid time periods.

**Analysis of `end_date` Field**

1.  **Purpose and Meaning:**
    *   Represents the concluding date of a specific time period.
    *   Primarily used within the context of time-off requests (`HrisCreateTimeOffRequestDto`) and time-off records (`TimeOff`).
    *   Indicates when the leave, shift change, or time entry period ends.

2.  **Data Types and Expected Values:**
    *   **Type:** Date (likely `String` or `DateTime` format, following ISO 8601 standard, as inferred).
    *   **Expected Value:** A valid date. It is a required field in the `HrisCreateTimeOffRequestDto` schema (implied by its presence without a `null` score context). It should represent a point in time.

3.  **Relationships:**
    *   Appears alongside `start_date` in both `HrisCreateTimeOffRequestDto` and `TimeOff` schemas, defining the temporal boundaries of the time-off period.
    *   Associated with other fields like `employee_id`, `approver_id`, `type`, `status`, and potentially `start_half_day`/`end_half_day` which might refine the period definition.
    *   Linked to `TimeEntryStatusEnum` (low score), suggesting it might be used in conjunction with status information for time entries, but the primary relationship seems to be with time-off.
