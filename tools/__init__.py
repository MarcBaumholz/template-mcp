Clean Tools Package for MCP Connector Server

This package contains the new phase-based organized tools for HR API mapping:

ACTIVE TOOLS (Phase-based organization):
- shared_utilities/: Common utilities used across all phases
- phase1_data_extraction/: Data extraction and API spec management
- phase2_analysis_mapping/: Analysis, mapping, and verification
- phase3_code_generation/: Code generation and testing

ARCHIVED TOOLS (moved to _archive/_archive/):
- All old individual tool files (api_spec_getter.py, rag_tools.py, etc.)
- Old directory structures (json_tool/, codingtool/, phase3/, etc.)
- Legacy tools and duplicate implementations

UNUSED TOOLS (moved to _archive/_unused/):
- Tools that are referenced but not actively used
- Enhancement tools and deprecated components
