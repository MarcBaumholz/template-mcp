**Generated:** {timestamp}
**Task:** Double-check field mappings and provide creative solutions for unmapped fields

## üìã INSTRUCTIONS FOR CURSOR

You are tasked with performing a comprehensive review of the field mapping analysis. Your goal is to:

1. **VERIFY** all field mappings are accurate and complete
2. **SEARCH** the API specification for any missed fields
3. **GENERATE** creative solutions for unmapped fields
4. **PROVIDE** implementation ideas and code examples

## üìä CURRENT MAPPING ANALYSIS
```markdown
{mapping_content}
```

## üîç UNMAPPED FIELDS DETECTED

The following fields require attention:

{self._format_unmapped_fields(unmapped_fields)}

## üí° CREATIVE SOLUTIONS

{self._format_creative_solutions(creative_solutions)}

## üéØ YOUR SPECIFIC TASKS

### 1. Double-Check All Mappings
- Review each mapped field in the analysis above
- Verify the mapping is technically correct
- Check for any logical inconsistencies
- Ensure data types are compatible

### 2. Search API Specification Thoroughly
- Re-examine the API spec for any missed fields
- Look for nested objects, optional fields, or alternative field names
- Check for fields that might be in different endpoints
- Consider fields that might be computed or derived

### 3. Creative Problem Solving
For each unmapped field, consider:
- **Transformation:** Can it be derived from existing fields?
- **Combination:** Can multiple API fields be combined?
- **Default Values:** Can reasonable defaults be provided?
- **Business Logic:** Can it be calculated using business rules?
- **Alternative Approaches:** Are there workarounds?

### 4. Implementation Ideas
Provide specific code examples for:
- Data transformation functions
- Field mapping logic
- Error handling for missing fields
- Validation rules
- Default value strategies

## üìÅ API SPECIFICATION REFERENCE

```json
{api_spec_content}
```

## ‚úÖ DELIVERABLES

Please provide:

1. **Verification Report:** Confirm or correct existing mappings
2. **Missing Fields Analysis:** Any fields you found that were missed
3. **Creative Solutions:** Specific approaches for unmapped fields
4. **Implementation Code:** Ready-to-use code snippets
5. **Recommendations:** Best practices and next steps

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

- Keep solutions simple and maintainable
- Provide error handling for edge cases
- Include validation logic
- Consider performance implications
- Document any assumptions made
- Use type hints and proper documentation

## üîÑ NEXT STEPS

After completing this analysis:
1. Update the mapping report with your findings
2. Implement the suggested solutions
3. Test the mapping logic thoroughly
4. Document any remaining limitations

---

**Remember:** The goal is to achieve the most complete and accurate field mapping possible while providing practical solutions for any gaps.
