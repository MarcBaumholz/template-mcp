# üß† Advanced API Schema Mapping with Structured Reasoning

You are an expert AI system integrator specializing in API field mapping. Your task is to analyze the provided OpenAPI specification and map source fields to the most appropriate destination fields using advanced reasoning patterns.

## üéØ Task Overview

This is a **direct-analysis task** that requires you to:
1. **Decompose** the complex mapping problem into manageable subproblems
2. **Reason** through each mapping decision step-by-step
3. **Verify** your reasoning at each step
4. **Synthesize** a comprehensive mapping solution

---

## üìä Source Field Analysis

Here is the analysis of the source data containing fields that need to be mapped, along with their descriptions, data types, and possible synonyms:

```markdown
{analysis_content}
```

---

## üìÑ Complete OpenAPI Specification

Here is the complete OpenAPI specification for the destination system. Analyze it systematically to find the correct endpoints and schema properties:

```json
{api_spec_content}
```

---

## üîç Structured Reasoning Process

Follow this **cumulative reasoning approach** with three distinct roles:

### **Role 1: Proposer** - Decompose and Suggest
Break down the mapping task into logical subproblems:

1. **Endpoint Identification**: Scan the API spec to identify the most relevant endpoint(s) for the source data context
2. **Schema Analysis**: Locate the request body schema for the identified endpoint(s)
3. **Field Mapping**: Map each source field to the most appropriate destination field
4. **Validation**: Verify that all mappings are logically sound and complete

### **Role 2: Verifier** - Evaluate and Refine
For each proposed mapping, verify:

- **Semantic Alignment**: Does the destination field represent the same concept as the source field?
- **Data Type Compatibility**: Are the data types compatible or can they be converted?
- **Business Logic**: Does the mapping make sense in the business context?
- **Completeness**: Are all source fields accounted for?

### **Role 3: Reporter** - Synthesize and Document
Compile the verified mappings into a comprehensive report.

---

## üß© Step-by-Step Mapping Process

### **Step 1: Endpoint Discovery**
**Let's think step by step:**

1. **Analyze the source context** - What type of data are we working with? (e.g., employee data, absence records, time tracking)
2. **Scan the API specification** - Look for endpoints that handle this type of data
3. **Identify the primary endpoint** - Which endpoint is most relevant for creating/updating this data?
4. **Document your reasoning** - Explain why you selected this endpoint

**Example reasoning pattern:**
```
Source context: "Absence Management/time offs"
Analysis: This appears to be employee absence/time-off data
API scan: Found endpoints like POST /absences, PUT /timeOffRequests, POST /leaveRequests
Selection: POST /absences (most direct match for absence data)
Reasoning: The endpoint name directly corresponds to the source context
```

### **Step 2: Schema Analysis**
**Let's think step by step:**

1. **Locate the request body schema** - Find the schema under `requestBody.content['application/json'].schema`
2. **Identify available fields** - List all properties in the destination schema
3. **Understand field types** - Note the data types and constraints for each field
4. **Document schema structure** - Create a clear overview of available destination fields

### **Step 3: Field Mapping with Reasoning Patterns**

For each source field, apply this **structured reasoning pattern**:

#### **Pattern A: Direct Match Analysis**
```
Source Field: [field_name]
Analysis: Looking for exact or near-exact matches
Reasoning: [step-by-step analysis]
Decision: [Direct Match/Semantic Match/No Match]
Justification: [detailed explanation]
```

#### **Pattern B: Semantic Match Analysis**
```
Source Field: [field_name]
Analysis: No direct match found, searching for semantic equivalents
Reasoning: [conceptual analysis]
Decision: [best semantic match or no match]
Justification: [why this mapping makes sense]
```

#### **Pattern C: No Match Analysis**
```
Source Field: [field_name]
Analysis: No suitable match found in the API specification
Reasoning: [why no match exists]
Decision: No Match
Recommendation: [suggested approach or TODO]
```

### **Step 4: Verification and Quality Assurance**

**Let's think step by step:**

1. **Review all mappings** - Ensure each source field has been properly analyzed
2. **Check for completeness** - Verify no source fields were missed
3. **Validate data types** - Confirm type compatibility or conversion requirements
4. **Test logical consistency** - Ensure the overall mapping makes business sense

---

## üìã Final Output Format

Produce a comprehensive mapping report using this structure:

### **üîç Endpoint Analysis**
**Selected Endpoint:** `[Your Identified Endpoint]`
**Reasoning:** [Why this endpoint was selected]

### **üìä Schema Overview**
**Available Destination Fields:** [List of all available fields in the schema]
**Key Field Types:** [Summary of data types and constraints]

### **üîÑ Field Mapping Results**

| Source Field | Destination Field | Match Type | Confidence | Reasoning | Data Type Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| `[field_1]` | `[dest_field_1]` | `Direct Match` | `High` | `Exact name match with same semantic meaning` | `string ‚Üí string` |
| `[field_2]` | `[dest_field_2]` | `Semantic Match` | `Medium` | `Maps to 'X' because it represents the same business concept` | `number ‚Üí string (conversion needed)` |
| `[field_3]` | `(No Match)` | `No Match` | `N/A` | `TODO: No equivalent found - consider custom field or business logic` | `N/A` |

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Mapping Notes and Recommendations**

**Data Type Conversions Required:**
- [List any necessary type conversions]

**Business Logic Considerations:**
- [Any special business rules or transformations needed]

**Missing Fields:**
- [Fields that couldn't be mapped and recommendations]

**Validation Rules:**
- [Any validation requirements for the mapped fields]

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your mapping will be considered successful if:
1. **All source fields are analyzed** - No field is left unexamined
2. **Reasoning is explicit** - Each decision is clearly justified
3. **Mappings are accurate** - Only fields that exist in the API spec are mapped
4. **Business logic is sound** - The overall mapping makes business sense
5. **Documentation is complete** - All decisions and recommendations are clearly documented

**Remember:** Only map to fields that actually exist in the API specification. If a field doesn't exist, mark it as "No Match" and provide a TODO recommendation for how to handle it.
