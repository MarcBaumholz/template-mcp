# API Integration Planning - Flip HRIS to StackOne

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Project:** Flip HRIS Absence Management to StackOne Time-off Integration  
**Source System:** Flip HRIS Absence Management API  
**Target System:** StackOne Time-off Management API  
**Started:** 2024-12-08 14:30:00 UTC  
**Last Updated:** 2024-12-08 14:30:00 UTC

## 🧠 BDI Analysis

### Beliefs
- **Source API Understanding:** Flip HRIS provides comprehensive absence management with employee data, absence types, duration tracking, and approval workflows
- **Target API Understanding:** StackOne offers time-off management with similar concepts but different field names and data structures
- **Domain Context:** HR absence management requires precise data mapping, status tracking, and approval workflows
- **Technical Constraints:** Both systems use REST APIs with different authentication methods (JWT vs API Key)
- **Data Complexity:** Nested employee objects, duration calculations, and status transitions need careful mapping

### Desires
- **Primary Goal:** Create seamless integration between Flip HRIS and StackOne for absence/time-off synchronization
- **Success Criteria:** 
  - 95%+ field mapping accuracy
  - All critical absence types supported
  - Proper status mapping and transitions
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Production-ready Kotlin microservice
- **Quality Requirements:**
  - Full test coverage with TDD approach
  - Security annotations and authentication
  - Null-safety and error handling
  - Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Intentions
1. **Phase 0:** Bootstrap environment and create strategic planning
2. **Phase 1:** Ingest API specifications and analyze source data structure
3. **Phase 2:** Perform comprehensive field mapping and validation
4. **Phase 3:** Generate production-ready Kotlin integration code
5. **Phase 4:** Create comprehensive TDD test suite and validate implementation

## 🌳 Task Strategy (ToT - Tree of Thoughts)

### Strategy A: Direct Field Mapping
- **Approach:** Map fields based on exact name matches and semantic similarity
- **Pros:** Fast, straightforward, high confidence for obvious matches
- **Cons:** May miss complex transformations and business logic
- **Use Case:** Simple field mappings like employeeId, startDate, endDate

### Strategy B: Semantic Field Analysis
- **Approach:** Use RAG-enhanced semantic analysis to understand field meanings and contexts
- **Pros:** Handles complex mappings, understands business context
- **Cons:** More complex, requires careful validation
- **Use Case:** Complex fields like absenceType → timeOffType, status mappings

### Strategy C: Hybrid Approach with Verification
- **Approach:** Combine direct mapping with semantic analysis, then verify against API specifications
- **Pros:** Best of both worlds, comprehensive validation
- **Cons:** Most complex, requires multiple iterations
- **Use Case:** Complete integration with high confidence

**Selected Strategy:** Strategy C - Hybrid approach for maximum accuracy and reliability

## 📊 Resource Requirements

### Source Data Files
- **Flip Absence Webhook:** `flip_absence_webhook.json` - Sample webhook data with employee absences
- **Flip API Specification:** `flip_hris_api_spec.yml` - Complete OpenAPI specification
- **StackOne API Specification:** `stackone_api_spec.json` - Target system API specification

### Expected Deliverables
- **Kotlin Microservice:** Complete Controller/Service/Mapper implementation
- **Test Suite:** Comprehensive TDD test coverage
- **Documentation:** Integration guide and API documentation
- **Quality Reports:** Code quality audit and test coverage reports

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework:** Micronaut with Kotlin
- **Security:** JWT authentication with Micronaut Security
- **Testing:** JUnit 5 with Micronaut Test
- **Logging:** SLF4J with structured logging
- **Null Safety:** Kotlin null-safety with proper error handling

## 🔍 Complexity Assessment

### High Complexity Areas
1. **Status Mapping:** Flip (pending/approved/rejected/cancelled) → StackOne (draft/submitted/approved/rejected/cancelled)
2. **Absence Type Mapping:** Flip (sick_leave/vacation/personal_leave) → StackOne (sick/vacation/personal)
3. **Duration Handling:** Flip (value/unit) → StackOne (days/hours)
4. **Employee Data:** Nested object mapping with different field structures

### Medium Complexity Areas
1. **Date Handling:** Both use ISO 8601 but need validation
2. **Pagination:** Different pagination structures
3. **Error Handling:** Different error response formats

### Low Complexity Areas
1. **Basic Fields:** employeeId, startDate, endDate, description
2. **Authentication:** Both support standard HTTP authentication
3. **HTTP Methods:** Both use standard REST patterns

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Mapping Accuracy:** >95% field coverage
- **Test Coverage:** >90% code coverage
- **Performance:** <500ms response time
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime
- **Security:** All endpoints properly secured
- **Maintainability:** Clean, documented, testable code

## 📋 Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Loss:** Incorrect field mapping could lose critical information
- **Status Inconsistency:** Mismatched status values could cause workflow issues

### Medium Risk
- **API Changes:** Future API updates could break integration
- **Performance:** Large data volumes could impact response times

### Low Risk
- **Authentication:** Standard HTTP authentication is well-supported
- **Error Handling:** Both APIs provide good error information

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Environment Setup:** Bootstrap development environment and verify RAG connectivity
2. **Data Ingestion:** Upload API specifications to RAG knowledge base
3. **Field Analysis:** Extract and analyze all relevant fields from source data
4. **Mapping Strategy:** Execute hybrid mapping approach with verification
5. **Code Generation:** Create production-ready Kotlin implementation
6. **TDD Validation:** Generate comprehensive test suite and validate implementation
